# VSP sample
# Using that file you will create:
#  - one SDC Vendor resource with "sample-vendor" name
#  - two SDC VSPs:
#      * one with "sample-vsp-anchor" name, where we use YAML's anchor to share vendor name between two resource,
#      * onw with "sample-vsp-no-anchor" name where we just simply copy&paste the name of the vendor we want to use.
#    It will also use "ubuntu.zip" package as an VSP artifact.
#    Remember: package value is a path, it has to point to the file from the `onap-data-provider` runner perspective.
#    I recommend to use absulute path to be sure there will be no errors.
