# Service sample
# Using that file you will create SDC Services both with custom properties and not.
# * sample-service-with-vf is a simple service with VF resource
# * sample-service-with-vf-and-properties is a service with VF resource and
#   it's properties - it's ready to create service instance using Macro flow
# * sample-service-with-pnf is a simple service with PNF resource
# * sample-service-with-pnf-and-properties is a service with PNF resource and
#   it's properties - it's ready to create service instance using Macro flow
# * sample-service-with-vl is a simple service with VL resource
# Make sure that resources you want to use are already created. If not - use `xnfs.yaml`
# sample file and create needed xNFs.
