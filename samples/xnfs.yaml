# VNFs and PNFs sample.
# In that sample we don't create any additional resources - just xNFs. Make
# sure that VSP you want to use already exists or use sample from `vsp.yaml`
# file and create it.
# It will also use "BASIC_VM_enriched.zip" package as an xNF artifact.
# Remember: package value is a path, it has to point to the file from the `onap-data-provider` runner perspective.
# I recommend to use absulute path to be sure there will be no errors.
